= Introduction =

This document an evolving To Do List for the DSM2 Sediment and Transport Module (STM) project.

The To Do Lists indicate tasks, work assignments, and status.

It is intended that this To Do List will be frequently modified by the project participants to
   * help plan the project direction
   * break project goals into small tasks
   * determine work assignments 
   * prioritize tasks
   * keep everyone informed of progress

Future tasks can be listed in broad terms at first and then later refined to smaller tasks.

The main areas for STM Single Channel Model are shown below

==Diffusion==
 * [http://code.google.com/p/dsm2-stm/issues/detail?id=1 Issue 1: ] Implement code tests as pass/fail tests for common scenarios and cases that could "break" the model 
 ** [http://code.google.com/p/dsm2-stm/issues/detail?id=2 Issue 2: ] Explicit diffusion operator subroutine unit tests
 ** [http://code.google.com/p/dsm2-stm/issues/detail?id=3 Issue 3: ] Interior diffusive flux subroutine unit tests
 ** [http://code.google.com/p/dsm2-stm/issues/detail?id=4 Issue 4: ] Boundary diffusive flux subroutine unit tests
 ** [http://code.google.com/p/dsm2-stm/issues/detail?id=5 Issue 5: ] Construct right hand side subroutine unit tests 
 ** [http://code.google.com/p/dsm2-stm/issues/detail?id=6 Issue 6: ] Construct diffusion matrix subroutine unit tests
 ** [http://code.google.com/p/dsm2-stm/issues/detail?id=7 Issue 7: ] Tri-diagonal matrix solver subroutine unit tests and analytical tests
 * [http://code.google.com/p/dsm2-stm/issues/detail?id=8 Issue 8: ] Adapt analytical tests to STM testing code framework
