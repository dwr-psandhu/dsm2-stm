Questions for the DWR from meeting on 12-14-09:

1) Regarding our question 6 from our e-mail to Eli on Friday, how should we proceed 
with the addition of the area? Could you please check that this is indeed a discrepancy and not our
misinterpretation? In the case it is a bug, should we include it in the source subroutine or make the
change in "extrapolate"? We would prefer to do it here, because it is ore clear to identify.

2) What are we going to do first, advection or diffusion in the splitting? The reason for doing diffusion
first is to smooth out potential problems with the solution in the previous time step, and the reason
for doing advection first is that it is the main transport mechanism.

3) What does the symbols "" mean in Doxygen?

4) Does test_gradient test the "difference" subroutine as well? Or another separate test code is needed? Our
understanding is that the subroutine is called in most tests to test other subrotines, so we are
wondering if there is an actual test for "differences".

5) Could you please give us a hint on what allocate_state(nx,nconst) means, or where to look for
information?

6) "flow" is a variable used in advect() to denote the volume flow rate or the discharge. When I saw it I felt
that this may be confusing to some people, because people talk about flow velocity, flow depth, etc. Should
we use a longer name, such as volume_flow_rate?

7) Eli, we have not been able to find a test of the boundary conditions for the advection part. Do you think 
we should include a test for the boundary conditions of the diffusion part?
